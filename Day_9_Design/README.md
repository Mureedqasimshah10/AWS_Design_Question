# Design & Develop Day 9 Project
---

### Design Problem Statement:
---
Client needs a Notification System â€“ that notifies the Admins about report summaries, users about operations within the system, notifying clients/users about any changes. What
AWS service(s) would you use for such a system?

## Environment Setup
---

* First install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For this, download WSL.exe file from Google. I faced error in installtion using wsl --install command so I used wsl.exe --install -d Ubuntu-20.04 commad to install it correctly.
* Dwnloaded VS Code and setup remote WSL from windows
* Download python3
* Donwload awscliv2.zip file from given path and install AWS. If you download it directly from google, there will be issue of path.
* Download and install NVM and NPM Check versions of all to be sure that softwares are installed corrrectly.

## Project Deployment - How to Run
---

* Open the ubuntu terminal and clone the git repository using git clone forked-repo-github-url Confirm that your working directory is `Sprint5_day9`
* Activate the virtual environment using command source .venv/bin/activate Configure the aws using aws configure and add your email and username to global configuration using command `git config --global user.email "your-email.gmail.com"` and `git config --global user.name "your-name"`
* Edit commands in pipelines_.ShellStep to add path of your directory. cd RootFolderName/ProjectFolderName/
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages
* Push changes to github. git commit -m "commit message" and git push Synth and Deploy the project on Consile using cdk synth and cdk deploy.


## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
